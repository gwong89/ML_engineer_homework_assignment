* Additional things that can be worked on that were not addressed


# Move bootstrapping into a seperate module, so this can apply to any dataset in the future(assuming I understand the intent of bootstrapping here)
# Remove all print statements and replace with logging, that way logging levels can determine what is emitted, can be stored
# Load/saving module into a seperate module
# refactoring selection/inconclusive classifier modules, lots of closure functions. May be possible to seperate out into useful modules
# pickling into a seperate module
# make code more readable following pep8 standards
